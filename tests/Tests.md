# Polyglot tests

This folder contains various subfolders, all of which contain a test app. To run the test, make sure you have the various polyglot binaries in your system path and then call `polybuild $(ls *.cpp *.rs *.d)` (you may need to modify this command for your terminal emulator). Each test has a README.md file that documents what the point of the test is.
